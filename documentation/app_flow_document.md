# App Flow Document for Akore User Portal

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

New users will begin by visiting the portal through a clear and inviting landing page or by receiving a direct link from Akore. On this page, they are given the option to sign up via a streamlined email-only registration process. The registration process is a multi-step journey. In the first step, the user enters all their basic information in addition to details for the Primary Entity that is specific to the configuration (in this case, Fuel Shipment Tracking System details). This includes both designated representative information and facility details. Only after all required fields are provided does the system trigger an email verification process where a time-sensitive token is sent to the user. Once the email has been verified, the user is prompted to create a secure password. When the password is set and all the necessary validations pass, the account is activated through Clerk, and the profile information along with the Primary Entity data is recorded in Supabase using the Clerk User ID as a link. Existing users can sign in using an email-only login interface. If a returning user needs to recover a lost password, a straightforward password reset procedure is available which follows the same secure standards and uses Clerk’s capabilities. Signing out is facilitated through a clearly visible sign-out option, ensuring that the user experience remains simple and intuitive.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After a successful login, the user is taken to a unified home page that serves as the central control hub. The dashboard is organized with an intuitive sidebar layout that features clear navigation between different sections. While the header provides quick information such as the user’s name, notifications, and basic account options, the sidebar lists all major sections like profile management, application-specific modules, and settings. This page also gives an overview of any pending actions or updates. The design is minimalistic yet professional with subtle green accents, following the standards established by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. Navigation between the dashboard, the profile pages, and the application-specific functionalities is seamless, ensuring a smooth transition as users move through the portal.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When a new user completes registration, they are first directed to the email verification page before finally reaching a welcome screen that confirms successful account creation. Within the dashboard, the user profile area displays the designated representative information where the user can view and edit their details that are stored in Supabase. Should the user need to change any contact information or update the facility details, they are taken through a simple editing process with clear fields and validation messages to prevent errors. Alongside the basic profile management, there is an application-specific module for Fuel Shipment Data Management that is tailored for the FSTS configuration. This module features a grid-style interface where users can interact with fuel shipment data. Users have controls to select a month, year, and facility from dropdown selectors which are immediately visible on the same page. They can then choose to upload a CSV file, in which case the system validates the file to ensure it meets the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection Fuel Shipment Information Form standards. The upload process includes a data preview grid where any errors, such as missing required fields or incorrect formats, are immediately displayed with clear textual feedback above the upload area. Additionally, users have options on the same page to download existing data in CSV format or to access a blank CSV template ready for input. The transitions between these pages, from uploading to reviewing data, resemble a continuous workflow where the user easily returns to the dashboard after their data operations are complete.

## Settings and Account Management

Within the unified dashboard, users can access a dedicated settings page where they have full control over their personal information and additional preferences. In this area, users are allowed to update their designated representative details, change their email preferences, or adjust notification settings, including toggling audit trail options so they can see a complete history of account actions. When it comes to billing or subscription settings, even though this version of the portal does not support modules like Stripe or AI features as they are disabled for FSTS, the design is ready to incorporate these functionalities in future configurations. The settings page is designed to be easily accessible via the sidebar, and once the user makes any changes, they are seamlessly returned to the main dashboard without the need to reload the entire interface, ensuring continuous user engagement.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Throughout the application, robust error handling strategies ensure that any user mistake or system issue is managed gracefully. If a user enters invalid data during registration or when editing their profile, the portal immediately displays understandable error messages that clearly state the problem and suggest corrective actions. Should a CSV file upload encounter issues because of missing data or formatting errors, the error messages are detailed and indicate the specific rows and requirements that need attention. In cases of poor connectivity or restricted actions such as unauthorized updates, fallback pages are used to inform the user of the issue, and they are provided with clear navigation options to return to a secure part of the app. Even when errors occur during background processes such as server-side validation or API requests, the user is given a non-intrusive alert on the screen and log entries are recorded so that the development team can investigate and resolve the issue later. The design also includes a comprehensive audit trail that gives a complete record of user actions, which contributes both to transparency for the user and diagnostic information for developers.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the moment a new user discovers the Akore User Portal to when they are actively engaged with its functionalities, the journey is designed to be smooth and interconnected. A user starts with a simple, secure registration experience that collects necessary personal and facility information, followed by a robust email verification and password setup. Once signed in, the user navigates a well-organized dashboard that provides quick access to profile management and the application-specific module for fuel shipment data operations. The user can seamlessly upload data, download reports, and receive immediate feedback on any issues, all while having the flexibility to adjust settings and view their audit trail. Even in error states, the application is careful to guide the user with clear instructions and safe fallback routes. In summary, the Akore User Portal offers a consistent, secure, and expandable environment that not only meets the needs of Fuel Shipment Tracking System users but is also built to adapt for future software applications.
